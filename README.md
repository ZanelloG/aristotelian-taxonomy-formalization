# Aristotelian Taxonomy Formalization

This repository contains a formal and computational reconstruction of Aristotle’s biological taxonomy, based on his main zoological works:

- *Historia Animalium*
- *De Partibus Animalium*
- *De Generatione Animalium*

The project aims to translate the implicit and distributed Aristotelian classification of animals into a formal ontology compatible with OWL/RDF environments, while preserving its philosophical and methodological coherence.

## Project Motivation

Aristotle’s zoology does not present a single, explicit taxonomic tree comparable to modern biological classifications. Instead, it emerges progressively from empirical descriptions, anatomical analyses, and causal–teleological explanations distributed across several works.

This project explores whether such a system can be:
- reconstructed in a logically consistent way,
- interpreted as an ontology in the sense of contemporary knowledge representation,
- implemented in a form suitable for automated reasoning.

Rather than imposing modern biological categories, the ontology is grounded in Aristotle’s own methodological principles, including:
- genus–species relations,
- functional and teleological explanations,
- causal distinctions (formal, final),
- rejection of rigid dichotomic division in favor of multi-criteria classification.

## Scope

The ontology focuses on:

- Aristotelian animal groups (e.g. sanguineous vs non-sanguineous animals)
- Morphological and functional properties
- Teleological constraints derived from *De Partibus Animalium*
- Generative distinctions from *De Generatione Animalium*

The project **does not aim** to provide a historically exhaustive reconstruction of Aristotelian biology, but rather a philosophically justified and computationally workable model.
